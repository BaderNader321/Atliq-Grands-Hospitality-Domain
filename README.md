## Company Details

**Atliq Grands**, a leading hospitality group with over two decades of experience, operates a chain of prestigious five-star hotels across India. Their portfolio includes Atliq Bay, Atliq City, Atliq Exotica, Atliq Grands, Atliq Palace, and Atliq Seasons, strategically located in four major metropolitan cities: Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Delhi.

## Project Overview

### Business Problem 

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

#### Task List
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

### Approach and Methodology

Here’s how we’ll approach the problem and turn the data into meaningful insights:

1. **Understanding the Business and Problem at Hand**
   We’ll start by breaking down the business model to fully grasp its goals and challenges. This helps us clearly define the problem we’re solving, keeping everything focused    
   and aligned with what matters most.

2. **Getting to Know the Data**
   We’ll dive into the datasets to understand their structure, key details, and quality. This step includes cleaning and fixing any missing or inconsistent data to ensure we’re  
   working with accurate and reliable information.

3. **Planning and Mockups**
   We’ll map out the entire project with clear milestones, deadlines, and resources. To keep everyone on the same page, we’ll create a mockup of the dashboard that shows what  
   the final product will look like, helping us visualize how the insights will be presented.

4. **Building a Solid Data Foundation**
   We’ll organize the data using a star schema, a simple structure that makes storing and analyzing information more efficient. This ensures we can quickly and effectively   
   answer any key questions.

5. **Applying Advanced Analysis**
   We’ll use advanced techniques to dig deeper into the data and uncover patterns or trends. The tools we choose will depend on the type of data and the questions we’re  
   answering.

6. **Designing the Dashboard**
   The dashboard will be crafted with care to ensure it’s user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing. It will be customized to the audience’s needs, making it easy to   
   understand and navigate.

7. **Delivering Clear Insights**
   At the end, we’ll present actionable recommendations backed by evidence. These insights will be shared in a straightforward way, ensuring everyone—regardless of their    
   technical expertise—can understand and act on the findings.

### Key Insights and Outcomes 

#### Further Analysis Section 
[Link](#further-analysis)

##### Key Metrics Overview:

1. **Average Rating:** A measure of guest satisfaction.
2. **RevPar (Revenue Per Available Room):** A key metric indicating how effectively a hotel is filling its rooms at a profitable rate.
3. **Occupancy %:** The percentage of available rooms occupied.
4. **Cancellation %:** The percentage of bookings canceled.

##### Insights by Room Class:

1. **Average Rating:** Presidential suites have a higher average rating compared to other room classes. Standard rooms have a comparatively lower average rating.
2. **RevPar:** Presidential suites generate the highest RevPar. Standard rooms have the lowest RevPar.
3. **Occupancy %:** Standard rooms exhibit the highest occupancy rate. Presidential suites have the lowest occupancy rate.
4. **Cancellation %:** Presidential suites experience the highest cancellation rate. Standard and Elite rooms share the lowest cancellation rate.

##### Insights by City:

1. **Average Rating:** Delhi has the highest average rating among the cities. Bangalore shows a comparatively lower average rating.
2. **RevPar:** Mumbai leads in RevPar generation. Bangalore has the lowest RevPar.
3. **Occupancy %:** Mumbai demonstrates the highest occupancy rate. Bangalore has the lowest occupancy rate.
4. **Cancellation %:** Hyderabad experiences the highest cancellation rate. Bangalore has the lowest cancellation rate.

##### Overall Performance Observations:

1. **Presidential Suites:** While they command the highest RevPar and a good average rating, they have the lowest occupancy and the highest cancellation rate. This suggests a 
   potential need to review pricing strategies or marketing to attract more guests to this premium offering or understand the reasons for high cancellations.

2. **Standard Rooms:** Despite having the lowest average rating and RevPar, they have the highest occupancy and low cancellation rates. This indicates a steady demand for 
   budget-friendly options, but there might be opportunities to enhance guest experience and potentially increase pricing.

3. **Mumbai:** Consistently performs well across all metrics (high RevPar, occupancy, and a decent average rating). This suggests a strong market presence in Mumbai.

4. **Bangalore:** Shows relatively weaker performance across most metrics (low RevPar, average rating, and occupancy). This might warrant further investigation into local market 
   dynamics and competition.

##### Additional Considerations:

* **Weekdays vs. Weekends:** The data shows fluctuations in occupancy and other metrics between weekdays and weekends. This is typical for hotels and should be factored into pricing and staffing strategies.

##### Recommendations:

1. **Presidential Suites:** Investigate the high cancellation rate. Consider targeted promotions or packages to improve occupancy. Analyze pricing compared to competitors.
2. **Standard Rooms:** Explore ways to improve guest satisfaction, potentially through minor upgrades or enhanced services. Evaluate if a slight price increase could be 
   justified.
3. **Bangalore Market:** Conduct a competitive analysis to understand why performance is lagging. Explore local partnerships or marketing initiatives to boost visibility and 
   demand.
4. **Overall:** Regularly monitor and analyze these metrics to identify trends and make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue and guest satisfaction.
